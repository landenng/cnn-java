# Convolutional Neural Network in Java
This project was create in the Summer of 2023 before I returned to University in
an effort to refresh my memory of Java as most of my programming until this point
has only required Python for the past year. 

As a result, I followed a tutorial to create this convolutional neural network
[here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpcNcOt2pg8k_YsrMjSwVdy3GX-rc_ZgN&si=2c_yW_bbSSadccOP)
in preparation for my Data Structures and Algorithms course in Java in Fall 2023.
This network is trained to recognize digits. The exact training and testing data
was removed from this project as it exceeded GitHub's size limit.
